⚓ Forecastle

The raised forward deck where anchor gear, chains, and mooring lines were stored.
Often cold and noisy — perfect for early “intro” or “tutorial” rooms in your Twine map.

🛏️ Crew’s Quarters

Living area for sailors. Cramped bunks, damp clothes, and the smell of oil and tobacco.
Good setting for early clues, small items (e.g. Candle), and personal notes.

📦 Store Rooms

General storage for provisions, tools, spare parts, and emergency rations.
Ideal “risk” rooms — you might lose steps rummaging for supplies or find something valuable.

🧭 Lobby (mid-deck)

Passenger corridor or central junction where stairs and access doors connect decks.
Neutral navigation space — good for sanity events or branching choices.

🚪 Staterooms

Private cabins for officers or passengers.
High lore potential — old photographs, record players, and personal diaries.

🍽️ Dining Saloon

Large communal hall for meals.
Could contain a Cracked Record or echoing sound motif; an eerie, silent feast scene works well here.

🔧 Engine Room

The mechanical heart of the ship: boilers, pistons, gauges, and heat.
Where the Wrench is crucial — use it to restore power or unlock the Command Deck route.
Perfect for sanity loss due to oppressive noise and heat.

🏛️ Assembly Room

Multi-purpose social hall used for gatherings or performances.
A psychological or “madness” space — echoes, distorted music, and false clues.

🪨 Coal Bunkers

Storage for coal feeding the boilers.
Dark, suffocating area; searching here costs heavy sanity or steps. Could hide one rare clue.

⚙️ Steering Gear Compartment

Below the stern, it housed the machinery controlling the rudder.
Endgame or fail state zone — flooded, jammed, or vibrating from strain.

📜 Captain’s Cabin

(Represented as “Lobby” near the top midship.)
Command quarters where the Captain’s Log Page might be found.
Contains direct narrative progression or meta hints for future runs.

🧩 Command Deck (Bridge)

The final destination — controls, navigation, and radio.
Reaching it completes the run; power or sanity thresholds determine endings.
